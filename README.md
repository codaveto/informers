This is a simple package that copies and alters the behaviour of Flutter’s `ValueNotifier`. The main difference is that the notifiers in this package allow for easier updating when having `iterables` like `maps` and `lists` as your value.

The idea for future development evolves around improving all informers to mimic default iterable’s behaviours and at the same time updating the listeners as efficient as possible. Feel free to make requests or a PR if you have any ideas and/or want to see any specific methods/classes added.
